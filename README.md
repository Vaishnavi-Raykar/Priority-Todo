# Priority based Todo-list with Daytona <NEXTJS, Typescript, Tailwind, CopilotKit>

In this project, I developed a Priority based Todo-list where users can add tasks, set priorities, mark tasks as complete, and delete them. The app is built using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and leverages CopilotKit to simplify task management interactions.
